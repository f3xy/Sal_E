# SAL_E
Enhancements for SAL <br />
Author: Johnny Brown <br />

What does it do...

Currently SAL_E enhances search results adding a few columns of useful information to the user from having to click on a machine to find useful information such as an ip address or current macos version(see below). It uses a browser extension to install, but the script is all javascript run once the page is loaded.
